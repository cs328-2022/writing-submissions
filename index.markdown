## About the Assignment
The task in the assignment is to write a data-driven summary that draws certain conclusions and presents arguments for the conclusions either visually or via summarizing tables or statistical tests. Students start from multiple (mostly) raw datasets bases on a specific analysis theme which might contain various imperfections, e.g. missing data. The final submissions were judged on the insights and how well the arguments are presented (e.g. visual illustrations, any number crunching, e.g. correlations derived, statistical tests used to support arguments, etc.). The assignment evaluation was an iterative process, where students improved further based on the feedback received in each stage. The Writing Studio@IITGN mentored the submissions for the writing part.
